DEBIAN + AD:

Step  0: Configure NTP cliente. Sudo apt-get install ntp ntpdate and change file /etc/ntp.conf
apt-get install ntp ntpdate
change file config add ntp pool and server (file: /etc/ntp.conf)
ntpq -p (view status)

Step 1: Check resolving

cat /etc/resolv.conf
here should be some think like
search ihb.local
nameserver 10.100.0.5
nameserver 172.16.100.4
Obs.: If dhcp is working 100% with domain, this manual config is not need.

 
Step 2: install software
sudo apt-get install sssd realmd -y
sudo apt-get install policykit-1
sudo apt-get install sssd-tools sssd libnss-sss libpam-sss adcli
sudo apt-get install packagekit

Step 3: try to join
realm join --user=hepta.alexsandro.f ihb.local
password for administrator:

Step 4: test join settings
realm list 
biopack.be 
type: kerberos 
realm-name: BIOPACK.BE 
domain-name: biopack.be 
configured: kerberos-member 
server-software: active-directory 
client-software: sssd 
required-package: oddjob 
required-package: oddjob-mkhomedir 
required-package: sssd 
required-package: adcli 
required-package: samba-common-tools 
login-formats: %U@biopack.be 
login-policy: allow-realm-logins

Step 5: AD
if successfully the server should appear in ad

Step 6: id testing
id administrator 
id: administrator: no such user
id administrator@biopack.be 
uid=1829600500...

Step 7: change behaviour
nano /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
change
use_fully_qualified_names = False 
ad_gpo_access_control = permissive
#Fallback you can change to what you wish
fallback_homedir = /home/%u@%d
#i use /home/%d@%u 
on debian systems you need to create the domain directory your self 
mkdir /home/YOUR_NETBIOS_NAME

Step 8: Create groupAllowGroups linuxadmin
Go to your ad and create a group give it some members.

Step 9: Create File
nano /etc/sudoers.d/sudoers 
%linuxadmin	ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
#replace LinuxAdmins with your own group you created in ad.

Step 10: restart sssd
systemctl restart sssd

Step 11: ssh test
ssh in yo your box
ssh domainuser@localhost 
#request root priveleges 
sudo su 
execute : whoami 
this should return root

Step 12: Domain Leave
if you wish to leave domain execute:domain realm leave biopack.be

The only other trick you might like to do is adding “session required pam_mkhomedir.so skel=/etc/skel/ umask=0022” to /etc/pam.d/common-session to automatically create homedirs. 

Using SSH configuration
To /etc/ssh/sshd_config, add a AllowGroups line:
AllowGroups linuxadmin

AllowGroups linuxadmin
From the manpage:
AllowGroups
  
Using pam_access
Add lines to /etc/security/access.conf of the form:
- : ALL EXCEPT (Domain) (Admin) : ALL
There are plenty of comments in that file which document how to use it. man pam_access is quite bare, so most information would come from those comments. pam_access is more powerful in that it can control non-SSH logins as well (TTYs, GUI, etc.). This particular line, for example, should deny any user who does not have Domain or Admin as a group from logging in at all (unless other lines allow them).
Both approaches are pretty flexible, and I don't know the pros and cons, so no recommendations.
